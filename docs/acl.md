# ServiceNow Access Control Rules (ACLs)

Access Control Rules (ACLs) in ServiceNow are used to control access to records, fields, and tables. They determine what users can and cannot do with data in the system.

## A useful analogy

Let's say you are going to an Airbnb. The host has a computer with no passcode, and open Wifi. 

As long as you have the address of the place, you can go to the place, and use the Wifi.
